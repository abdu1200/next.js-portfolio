This project demonstrates a full-stack note management application that
integrates React on the frontend with Django as the backend. Built to manage
notes with CRUD functionalities, this app serves as an example of how React and
Django can work together to create dynamic and efficient web applications.

## Features

- **Note Management**: Users can create, read, update, and delete notes.
- **REST API**: Exposes endpoints to manage notes, ensuring smooth client-server
  interactions.
- **User Authentication**: Allows users to sign up, log in, and securely manage
  their notes.
- **Responsive UI**: A user-friendly and responsive interface built with React.
- **Data Persistence**: Utilizes Django and a relational database for data
  management.

## Technologies

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building interactive user
  interfaces.
- **Django**: A robust Python web framework used as the backend.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides the tools to build and manage RESTful API
  endpoints.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database option used for development (or
  MySQL/PostgreSQL for production).
- **JWT Authentication**: Secures the application by handling user
  authentication with JSON Web Tokens.
